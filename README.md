## Structure

To be determined

## Contribute

Future contributions must be done by pull request only. A branch protection rule will be created to ensure no commits directly on main.
Branching strategy to be used is the [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

This means that you create a short-lived branch, make your changes there, and do a pull request to merge with main branch. The code/content will then be reviewed by Omnia Product Team, and evaluated based on company policy compliance.
